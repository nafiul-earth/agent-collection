Result:

The most effective PokÃ© Balls to use when trying to catch an angry Mew are the Master Ball and the Premier Ball.

The Master Ball is a top-tier option that guarantees a successful catch, even against the most elusive or angry PokÃ©mon. Its effectiveness lies in its high capture rate and ability to bypass any weaknesses or resistances the target may have.

On the other hand, the Premier Ball is an excellent secondary option for catching angry Mew. As one of the best PokÃ© Balls designed specifically for hard-to-catch PokÃ©mon, it boasts a higher catch rate than standard PokÃ© Balls. Additionally, its ability to ignore evasion stats makes it particularly effective against PokÃ©mon with high evasion abilities.

Given that Mew is considered a mythical PokÃ©mon and can be quite elusive, using both the Master Ball and Premier Ball will increase the chances of a successful capture. It's also worth noting that having a sufficient amount of PokÃ© Balls in one's inventory can help reduce stress during battles, allowing trainers to make better decisions about which ball to use.

The best course of action would be for the trainer to have both the Master Ball and Premier Ball at their disposal, ensuring they have the highest possible chance of catching Mew.
